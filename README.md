## My Personal Solutions
This is a repo of all of the solutions I created to problems found on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).

## Description
Each folder is named after an exercise found in [here](http://exercism.io/languages/python/exercises).

## Languages Used
Although [exercism](http://exercism.io/) supports many programming languages, python is used in solving all of these exercises.
